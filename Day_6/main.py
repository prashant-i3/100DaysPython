# Indentation : provides readers with a sense of continuity.
# in Python:- Indentation in Python refers to the whitespaces (spaces or tabs) at the start of the line to indicate a block of code. The leading whitespaces (space and tabs) at the start of a line are used to determine the indentation level of the line.

# For Loop:
